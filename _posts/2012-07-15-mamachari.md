I finally came over myself and bought one. For transportation, a bit comfort and to see how it is to be a cycler in Tokyo. Introducing, my brand new Mamachari:

I bought it in Asakusa. Sadly I couldn't take it by train (maybe I should have bought a foldable one?) so I had to cycle all the way from Asakusa to Takadanobaba back. Took me around 4 hours but wow! That was fun!

It was around 10.000 yen (is that much for a mamachari? I don't know) at a nice friendly store near the Asakusa central hotel. I can't really remember the name though.

Now looking for cycling partners! :)
