My friend Yubin was a pretty good guide! We went to so many places and she was able to tell me the story about everything. Just like she prepared for it (though she didn't).

We even wrote some Hangul :p (That's hers! Mine looked way worse xD)

Seoul is a great city. Reminds me a little on tokyo! You can see so many things as a tourist and buy soo much stuff (K-Pop for example ;)). There are shops everywhere on the street! Also it seems that Koreans are somewhat attracted to Dunkin Doughnuts and Baskin Robbins. I've never seen so many of these!

Yet it feels... familiar. I constantly had to think about europe. It just... feels like europe!
