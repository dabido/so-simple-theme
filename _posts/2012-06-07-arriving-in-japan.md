Next stop was the Sakura House office in Shinjuku. I checked in, got the instructions how to get to my room, the keys and everything was fine. Right after a 30 minutes train ride i arrived already in my room in quiet and calm Zoshigaya.

Finally that time has come. Free from work and ready for vacation! After a rough 14 hours flight (with changing in Copenhagen) I finally arrived in Tokyo, breathing the humid air again.

It's been 1 year, wow...
