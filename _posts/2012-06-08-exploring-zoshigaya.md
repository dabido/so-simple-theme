Zoshigaya is a pretty nice place to live. It's not noisy or crowdy, rather calm and relaxing.

I found a supermarket right around the corner and a kombini next door. The stations nearby are Zoshigaya Metro Station and JR Takadanobaba station (it's a little walk to that though.)

There are even some little temples around here!

(OT: I love temples.)

I think Zoshigaya is awesome to live! It's nice and relaxing but very near at the center (Shinjuku) at the same time!
