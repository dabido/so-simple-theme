It's located near the Hamamatsucho station. Take a look at the map here - [http://www.pokemon.co.jp/gp/pokecen/english/images/map_tokyo_e.pdf](http://www.pokemon.co.jp/gp/pokecen/english/images/map_tokyo_e.pdf)

Already when arriving at the station, you will see little signs, guiding you to the pokemon center there.

After around 5 minutes walk from the station we arrived at the center. Lot's of people from all ages were sitting infront of it and playing Pokemon - You can't really miss it! (I think you will get some ingame presents if you go there with your game)

The center itself is a big store for all kind of Pokemon goods.

You can get Plushies, Hangers, Towels, Cards, Games, Fans, Pens, ... - easy said: Everything. The prices are so-so. A small plushie costs around 700yen. A bigger one around 1000. I think that's OK!

If you want to buy a Pokemon plushie in Germany you will most likely pay around 30â‚¬.

Are you a Pokemon fan? Well, you should definitely go there! (It's very crowdy though!) I didn't really buy anything but for the photos the trip was definitely worth it!
