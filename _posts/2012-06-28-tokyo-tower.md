Costs around 800 yen to go up. It's splitted into "Main Observatory" and the "Special Observatory" which costs around 600 yen extra.

The Main Observatory is located at 150m height, the Special Observatory at 250m. Sadly we were too late for the special one so only Main Observatory this time.

There was a little concert at the top, though I don't know the artists name. Had to be someone famous as a lot of people were clapping to his songs :p.

Anyway! The view was great but the windows a little too dirty to take good pictures. What a pity!
