Yesterday I got invited to Korea by a friend from the Internet called "Yubin" (Interpals profile: http://www.interpals.net/Yuki2809). For 1 week. And did i do it? Of course I did. At around 10 pm, i booked the flight for today and here I am now. In Korea! Seoul to be specific.

Yubin picked me up from the airport and guided me through Shinchon.

The weather is faaar better than the one in Japan at the moment (pretty rainy...). The sun is shining, everything is warm, the air is humid. What a nice first day!

I even tried Korean BBQ!
