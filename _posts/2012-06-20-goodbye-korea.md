I had a nice last day in "Lotte World", an amusement park in Seoul and watched the Water Show at the Hangang River after.

At around 2 p.m. the next day, we started going back to Incheon airport, preparing to say good bye. But was it that easy? Of course not.

At the same time there was a Taifun in Japan. My flight got delayed by 30 minutes. After these 30 minutes still no new infos. We went to a Korea air information thing and asked about the current situation and here it comes - the flight got cancelled. Like all flights from Seoul to Tokyo on that day.

But it gets worse, the replacement flight is on the next day, at around 7 am! Means checkin is at 6. That wouldn't be a serious problem. That Seoul trains and buses start driving at 5 is one.

Conclusion: Wait at the airport. The whole night. __14 hours__. Luckily my friend was willing to stay with me the WHOLE night. That was indeed an unique experience!
