Okonomiyaki is often called a "Japanese pancake". For me it wasn't a pancake at all. More a... strange mix... of everything you want. Put it together, mix it with egg and cabbage and there you go - okonomiyaki!

The restaurant kinda reminded me of Korean BBQ. Inmiddle of each desk is a hot plate. You order your food, the waitress brings the stuff and mixes it infront of your eyes together. Then puts it on the hot plate, adds a cover and tells you to turn it after 4 minutes. Looks something like that:

After turning and cooking for another 4 minutes we were ready to eat it. We tried two different ones. The first one is mixed cabbage with egg, surrounded by some rice crackers.

The second one was choosen by me. It was egg mixed with cabbage mixed with some pork mixed with noodles mixed with another egg on top. In the end when the waitress finished adding them together it looked something like that:

Cooking it for another 8 minutes and we were ready to eat. It tasted... well, I can't really describe the taste. But it was good!

The restaurant was the ぱすたかん inside Shinjukus MyLord. Try it!
