Kamakura is a city, around 50km away from Tokyo. Right at the ocean. We went there by riding the Shonan-Shinjuku line from Shibuya to Zushi, leaving the train at Kamakura station. Costs around 900 yen.

There is also the "Daibutsu", 大仏 or "Great Buddha" inside Kōtoku-in. A big bronze buddha statue.

You can even go inside it! Though we missed that. We didn't know the exact opening shedule so we arrived right after it closed :(

After going to the beach a little, we went back to Tokyo and the day was already over. Time's passing by so fast when having fun!
