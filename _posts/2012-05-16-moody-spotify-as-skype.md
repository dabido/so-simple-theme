After a while of searching how to automatically update your Skype mood to your Spotify song, I found this little tool called [Moody](http://alexandernilsson.com/entry/moody-show-what-spotify-is-currently-playing-as-a-mood-message-on-skype-for-mac-os-x).

A simple application which uses Spotifys and Skypes applescript API to simply update the Skype mood all x seconds.

I've adopted that logic and ported Moody to Objective C - presenting Moody v1.0! A very simple background application which does exactly what the applescript brother does - just in the background and with ObjC.
