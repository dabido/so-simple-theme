Going to japan and not climbing fuji would be somewhat... wrong, so of course I had to do it. Fuji is 3776m high, the climbing season usually starts in july and ends in early september. I think you can also climb it off season but during the season it's easier or something. Maybe because it's not that cold on the top? I don't know.

There are different ways to climb fuji. From the tokyo site you usually go either from the bottom (takes 12h to the top) or the middle (6h). 6h climbing is enough for me. We picked the way from the middle. To be specific, Fujisan 5th station (富士山五合目).

You can go there by bus only during the season, we reserved our tickets on highwaybus (https://highwaybus.com/rs-web01-prd-rel/gp/index). The whole trip was around 5.000円.

Mostly people climb fuji to see the sunset or the sunrise on the summit. We picked the sunrise for us and started going there at 7 pm from Shinjuku. At 10:30 we arrived at 5th station and started climbing through the night.

The way is more or less splitted into different "parts". At first you are just following a way. More like hiking. After a while the way turns into serpentines. Zig-zag. This lasts for some hours and is still kinda easy to go.

During your way to the top you will arrive at some "stations" and smaller houses. There are toilets for 200円 and some snacks sold by people living there. Usually hikers use these places for breaks.

After a few hours of serpentines the way turns very very rocky. This is were hiking is over. You are actually "climbing" stones straight up to the top. As the way gets more and more narrow you will find yourself in a point where you actually stand in a queue behind some other people before you can step on the next rock! (Maybe only because we went there on weekend... I don't know...)

This is where it gets annoying. Your speed depends completely on the people infront of you! If just 1 person takes a break to take a picture or something, everyone behind him (including you, even if your 10 people after) has to wait until he finished. A hint: Use stations to go infront of people groups as they will very likely be in your way!

This escalates when you nearly reach the top and the sun is slowly coming out. As everyone there wants to take a picture of the sunrise, no one will continue walking. We usually had to wait 10 seconds or more to take the next step to the top.

The bigger problem is that during the whole trip, you sweat a lot! When moving you don't really feel cold, but when standing (even if it's just for 10 seconds) you can really feel the 5°C at the summit.

After 7h straight climbing we did it! We stood on the top of mount fuji and enjoyed the morning sun.

The way down was around 3-4 hours but because of the slippy way much harder than ascending (at least for me). But now you can finally enjoy the beautiful view and the warm sunlight, even on cold fuji!

Thank you fuji for this awesome day! ありがとうございました！
