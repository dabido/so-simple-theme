    &lt;p&gt;Going to japan and not climbing fuji would be somewhat… wrong, so of course I had to do it. Fuji is 3776m high, the climbing season usually starts in july and ends in early september. I think you can also climb it off season but during the season it’s easier or something. Maybe because it’s not that cold on the top? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different ways to climb fuji. From the tokyo site you usually go either from the bottom (takes 12h to the top) or the middle (6h). 6h climbing is enough for me. We picked the way from the middle. To be specific, Fujisan 5th station (富士山五合目).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can go there by bus only during the season, we reserved our tickets on highwaybus (https://highwaybus.com/rs-web01-prd-rel/gp/index). The whole trip was around 5.000円.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly people climb fuji to see the sunset or the sunrise on the summit. We picked the sunrise for us and started going there at 7 pm from Shinjuku. At 10:30 we arrived at 5th station and started climbing through the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/kCGDF.jpg?1&quot; alt=&quot;Sign at Fuji trail start&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way is more or less splitted into different “parts”. At first you are just following a way. More like hiking. After a while the way turns into serpentines. Zig-zag. This lasts for some hours and is still kinda easy to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During your way to the top you will arrive at some “stations” and smaller houses. There are toilets for 200円 and some snacks sold by people living there. Usually hikers use these places for breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few hours of serpentines the way turns very very rocky. This is were hiking is over. You are actually “climbing” stones straight up to the top. As the way gets more and more narrow you will find yourself in a point where you actually stand in a queue behind some other people before you can step on the next rock! (Maybe only because we went there on weekend… I don’t know…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where it gets annoying. Your speed depends completely on the people infront of you! If just 1 person takes a break to take a picture or something, everyone behind him (including you, even if your 10 people after) has to wait until he finished. A hint: Use stations to go infront of people groups as they will very likely be in your way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This escalates when you nearly reach the top and the sun is slowly coming out. As everyone there wants to take a picture of the sunrise, no one will continue walking. We usually had to wait 10 seconds or more to take the next step to the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bigger problem is that during the whole trip, you sweat a lot! When moving you don’t really feel cold, but when standing (even if it’s just for 10 seconds) you can really feel the 5°C at the summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 7h straight climbing we did it! We stood on the top of mount fuji and enjoyed the morning sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/vfPeX.jpg?1&quot; alt=&quot;Morning sun on top of Fuji mountain&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way down was around 3-4 hours but because of the slippy way much harder than ascending (at least for me). But now you can finally enjoy the beautiful view and the warm sunlight, even on cold fuji!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/vIzjv.jpg?1&quot; alt=&quot;Way down #1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/mdZRU.jpg?1&quot; alt=&quot;Way down #2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you fuji for this awesome day! ありがとうございました！&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The one who doesn’t climb fuji is a fool. The one who does it twice is a even bigger fool.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I finally came over myself and bought one. For transportation, a bit comfort and to see how it is to be a cycler in Tokyo. Introducing, my brand new Mamachari:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought it in Asakusa. Sadly I couldn’t take it by train (maybe I should have bought a foldable one?) so I had to cycle all the way from Asakusa to Takadanobaba back. Took me around 4 hours but wow! That was fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was around 10.000 yen (is that much for a mamachari? I don’t know) at a nice friendly store near the Asakusa central hotel. I can’t really remember the name though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now looking for cycling partners! :)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It’s located near the Hamamatsucho station. Take a look at the map here - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pokemon.co.jp/gp/pokecen/english/images/map_tokyo_e.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.pokemon.co.jp/gp/pokecen/english/images/map_tokyo_e.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already when arriving at the station, you will see little signs, guiding you to the pokemon center there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/ZS8PU.jpg?1&quot; alt=&quot;Pokemon center sign&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After around 5 minutes walk from the station we arrived at the center. Lot’s of people from all ages were sitting infront of it and playing Pokemon - You can’t really miss it! (I think you will get some ingame presents if you go there with your game)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Dhpw3.jpg?1&quot; alt=&quot;Infront of the pokemon center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The center itself is a big store for all kind of Pokemon goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get Plushies, Hangers, Towels, Cards, Games, Fans, Pens, … - easy said: Everything. The prices are so-so. A small plushie costs around 700yen. A bigger one around 1000. I think that’s OK!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to buy a Pokemon plushie in Germany you will most likely pay around 30€.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/PeZO5.jpg?1&quot; alt=&quot;Pokemon plushies!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you a Pokemon fan? Well, you should definitely go there! (It’s very crowdy though!) I didn’t really buy anything but for the photos the trip was definitely worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Okonomiyaki is often called a “Japanese pancake”. For me it wasn’t a pancake at all. More a… strange mix… of everything you want. Put it together, mix it with egg and cabbage and there you go - okonomiyaki!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restaurant kinda reminded me of Korean BBQ. Inmiddle of each desk is a hot plate. You order your food, the waitress brings the stuff and mixes it infront of your eyes together. Then puts it on the hot plate, adds a cover and tells you to turn it after 4 minutes. Looks something like that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/PrRpL.jpg?1&quot; alt=&quot;Okonomiyaki in progress #1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After turning and cooking for another 4 minutes we were ready to eat it. We tried two different ones. The first one is mixed cabbage with egg, surrounded by some rice crackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/KtrbW.jpg?1&quot; alt=&quot;Okonomiyaki in progress #2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one was choosen by me. It was egg mixed with cabbage mixed with some pork mixed with noodles mixed with another egg on top. In the end when the waitress finished adding them together it looked something like that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/q1t0W.jpg?1&quot; alt=&quot;Okonomiyaki in progress #3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooking it for another 8 minutes and we were ready to eat. It tasted… well, I can’t really describe the taste. But it was good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restaurant was the ぱすたかん inside Shinjukus MyLord. Try it!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Costs around 800 yen to go up. It’s splitted into “Main Observatory” and the “Special Observatory” which costs around 600 yen extra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Main Observatory is located at 150m height, the Special Observatory at 250m. Sadly we were too late for the special one so only Main Observatory this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a little concert at the top, though I don’t know the artists name. Had to be someone famous as a lot of people were clapping to his songs :p.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway! The view was great but the windows a little too dirty to take good pictures. What a pity!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Kamakura is a city, around 50km away from Tokyo. Right at the ocean. We went there by riding the Shonan-Shinjuku line from Shibuya to Zushi, leaving the train at Kamakura station. Costs around 900 yen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the “Daibutsu”, 大仏 or “Great Buddha” inside Kōtoku-in. A big bronze buddha statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even go inside it! Though we missed that. We didn’t know the exact opening shedule so we arrived right after it closed :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After going to the beach a little, we went back to Tokyo and the day was already over. Time’s passing by so fast when having fun!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I had a nice last day in “Lotte World”, an amusement park in Seoul and watched the Water Show at the Hangang River after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 2 p.m. the next day, we started going back to Incheon airport, preparing to say good bye. But was it that easy? Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time there was a Taifun in Japan. My flight got delayed by 30 minutes. After these 30 minutes still no new infos. We went to a Korea air information thing and asked about the current situation and here it comes - the flight got cancelled. Like all flights from Seoul to Tokyo on that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it gets worse, the replacement flight is on the next day, at around 7 am! Means checkin is at 6. That wouldn’t be a serious problem. That Seoul trains and buses start driving at 5 is one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Wait at the airport. The whole night. &lt;strong&gt;14 hours&lt;/strong&gt;. Luckily my friend was willing to stay with me the WHOLE night. That was indeed an unique experience!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;… aaaand we went to the center of Seoul! :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/g69yC.jpg?1&quot; alt=&quot;King Sejong&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend Yubin was a pretty good guide! We went to so many places and she was able to tell me the story about everything. Just like she prepared for it (though she didn’t).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We even wrote some Hangul :p (That’s hers! Mine looked way worse xD)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/UcbmP.jpg?1&quot; alt=&quot;Yubin&#39;s Hangeul&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seoul is a great city. Reminds me a little on tokyo! You can see so many things as a tourist and buy soo much stuff (K-Pop for example ;)). There are shops everywhere on the street! Also it seems that Koreans are somewhat attracted to Dunkin Doughnuts and Baskin Robbins. I’ve never seen so many of these!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it feels… familiar. I constantly had to think about europe. It just… feels like europe!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got invited to Korea by a friend from the Internet called “Yubin” (Interpals profile: http://www.interpals.net/Yuki2809). For 1 week. And did i do it? Of course I did. At around 10 pm, i booked the flight for today and here I am now. In Korea! Seoul to be specific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yubin picked me up from the airport and guided me through Shinchon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather is faaar better than the one in Japan at the moment (pretty rainy…). The sun is shining, everything is warm, the air is humid. What a nice first day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even tried Korean BBQ!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Zoshigaya is a pretty nice place to live. It’s not noisy or crowdy, rather calm and relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a supermarket right around the corner and a kombini next door. The stations nearby are Zoshigaya Metro Station and JR Takadanobaba station (it’s a little walk to that though.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are even some little temples around here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/lSK5R.jpg?1&quot; alt=&quot;Temple in Zoshigaya&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(OT: I love temples.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Zoshigaya is awesome to live! It’s nice and relaxing but very near at the center (Shinjuku) at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Next stop was the Sakura House office in Shinjuku. I checked in, got the instructions how to get to my room, the keys and everything was fine. Right after a 30 minutes train ride i arrived already in my room in quiet and calm Zoshigaya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally that time has come. Free from work and ready for vacation! After a rough 14 hours flight (with changing in Copenhagen) I finally arrived in Tokyo, breathing the humid air again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been 1 year, wow…&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After a while of searching how to automatically update your Skype mood to your Spotify song, I found this little tool called &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexandernilsson.com/entry/moody-show-what-spotify-is-currently-playing-as-a-mood-message-on-skype-for-mac-os-x&quot;&gt;Moody&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple application which uses Spotifys and Skypes applescript API to simply update the Skype mood all x seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve adopted that logic and ported Moody to Objective C - presenting Moody v1.0! A very simple background application which does exactly what the applescript brother does - just in the background and with ObjC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/LezoW.png&quot; alt=&quot;Moody screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download it here - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/downloads/dabido/Moody/Moody.zip&quot;&gt;https://github.com/downloads/dabido/Moody/Moody.zip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or fork it here - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dabido/Moody&quot;&gt;https://github.com/dabido/Moody&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps someone.&lt;/p&gt;
